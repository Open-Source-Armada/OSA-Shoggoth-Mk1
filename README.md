# OSA-Shoggoth-Mk1
The Shoggoth Mk1 is a heavy 12 gun meta fighter, with a huge amount of armour mass, slow but lethal, potential to threaten even max voxel ships. Comes in autocannon, laser and plasma.


//Specs//


12 mounted weapons with a staggered fire trigger system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Rapidfire button switches between staggered fire (gun 2 will stagger behind gun 1 creating a machine gun effect) and alpha strike (both guns fire together).

BoostMin and BoostMax act as a aim keybind without yolo (yolo is avoided where possible due to the 0.2 delay) these should ALWAYS be bound to the same key.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

This can be altered to be the more common method of aiming, having higher sense as standard, and having the ships pitch/yaw slow down for aiming. (Swap the BoostMin/BoostMax Off values with its On values, remember to set it in the pitch/yaw lever fields too)

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Its primarily plated using a char with alloys across the front face of the ship.

108 m/s max speed using T3 thrusters.

4172631 kg in weight.

4 small prop tanks for 4 million prop, 1 hour estimated flight time.

6 T1 fuel chamber, 18 T1 generators, 6 T1 enhancers, 50 mins estimated fight time.

Basic script for current Fuel/Prop times.

Uses basic FCU, no reverse, roll is performed using Roll_L and Roll_R buttons, this is to allow fast handling by isolating the roll thrusters from the FCU/MFC.

Entry is by going prone in the access port looking forward and clicking the seat.

//Tactics//


Over armoured for its size, with 12 guns, this ship is good at only one thing.

Plowing through incoming fire at a slow but staedy pace.

12 gun are practical constant firing, making you a floating turret able to demo or damage any ship that comes in range.

The armour is over abundant and in almost all directions, the rear also has a large plate firewall.

Has the capacity to pose a threat to the largest of ships if not removed from the field.

Best used in defensive situations, where the ship is close for repair and resupply.

This ship is not ideal in gravity, due to its high weight and no side thrusters, is primarily made for zero g fighting.

Possible good center piece for a fleet op with smaller fighters in support.


//Design//


This ship is made to compromise as little as possible in the method or armouring i know.

Armour is front facing to survive orbit fights, this ship should have a great advantage against other ships of its class, can tank larger ships as well.

Side, top, bottom and thruster plates are made of the largest possible, to increase the "Magic Health" of the plates.

Large triangle plates are used as much as possible due to them having great performance against all mounted weapons, pound for pound best all round plate.

Front of the ship is composed of stacked large plates, made of char, that surround the guns and is the core armour located at the front.

As well as having high magic health, the direction the plates are stacked to take advantage of the voxel damage system.

When a plates health is broken, it will begin taking voxel damage, by stacking the plates lengthwise you ensure the projectile must pass through as much material as possible.

Plates (even small plates) can resist multiple rounds on top of there magic health, if the plate is broken but still on the ship, it wil continue to provide some protection.

This method is best against lasers, as magic health is quickly destroyed by laser weapons and above.

It is also segmented, meaning that that the damage will be spread across multiple plates instead of one, reducing the chance of well aimed burst penetrating your armour.

Surrounding this voxel armour are more large triangles, to cover up the angles the voxel plates will not apply it effects.

Along the very prow of the ship are bastonium railings, this is sacrifice plating to adsorb damage from plasma/railguns.

Unlike lasers, plasma and railguns excel at breaking large plate health AND voxel armour, while lacking crit chance on explosive components.

Without sacrifice plating, it is only a matter of time before you armour is gone and your ship is rendered unflyable.

Where plasma/rails do not do well against is ironically, small plates, as the shatter damage dealt struggles to spread from plate to plate.

This means using smaller plates on the outer layer is in fact a great technique, and can protect your core armour from deadly alpha strikes with late game weapons.

These plates still help with lower tier weapon fire.

This ship has autocannon, laser and plasma versions, i consider higher tier weapons to hold less value on smaller ships vs big, so use to your taste.

This ship is not even close to max speed as it would require a massive nerf to the voxel armour, which had little to no effect to speed, making heavy char the best option.
